# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions  

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! This is where I document my journey through various coding challenges, covering different topics and difficulty levels.  

## 📌 About  
This repository contains my solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), including:  
- **SQL 50** (Easy & beyond)  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** (Python, Java, etc.)  
- **Other categories** (to be expanded over time)  

Each solution is written with readability and efficiency in mind, often including explanations and alternative approaches.
